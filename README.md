# FoodX-251_Classification

This repository contains the project for the masterâ€™s degree course in 
**Visual Information Processing and Management** at the **University of Milan-Bicocca**. 
The project involves the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system 
or application that utilizes a selected image database. The project 
incorporates the following mandatory components:

1. **Initial Model Training**: Train the model using the provided training 
    set, which includes 20 images per class.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Expand the training set by adding images from the 
    unlabeled dataset, increasing the number of images in each class.
3. **Fine-Grained Food Classification**: Classify the validation set into 
    251 food classes as defined by the dataset.
4. **Classification of Degraded Images**: Perform classification of the 
    validation set under degraded conditions into the same 251 food classes.
5. **Objective Assessment of Results**: Conduct an objective evaluation of 
    the classification results.
6. **Visual Analysis**: Provide a visual analysis of significant cases.
7. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different strategies tested during the 
    project to identify the optimal solution.
